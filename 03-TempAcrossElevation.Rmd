# Stream Reach Temperatures by Elevation

The sampled reaches are associated with different elevations throughout the watershed. I will map the distribution here and color code points by which river they belong to.

```{r temperature1, eval = TRUE}
library(ggplot2)

reaches %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = elevation_m, x = temp_rank, color = river_name)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(fill = 'Total Upstream Drainage Area (sqKm)',
       y = 'Elevation (m)', 
       x = 'Temperature (m)', 
       color = 'River') +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```
As expected, the temperature rank for the sampled reaches tends to be higher in lower elevations. This would be helpful if I was trying to understand how temperature changes throughout a river as elevation decreases and rivers gain more tributaries.
